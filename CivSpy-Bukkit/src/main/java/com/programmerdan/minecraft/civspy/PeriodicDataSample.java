 * Simple implementation of a DataSample, this encapuslates a server/world/player (max granularity) sampling of data, done on a distinct period.
 * As it is sampled and not event driven, this is data not meant to be aggregated by CivSpy, as it is best presented using histograms
 * and statistic analysis.
 *
 * Ideally the period should be stable.
